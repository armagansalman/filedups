"""

Design/Decisions/Definitions:
    + A 'file' is an ordered sequence of bytes.
        It has a non-negative size. 
        A slice of its bytes can be read given a 'start_idx' and
        'end_idx'.
    
    + FilesInfo type:
        + Has 'locations' iterable which holds multiple 'location' 
        values. A 'location' can be any type as long as it can be read 
        from a user given reader function.
        
        + Has 'reader_func' function that reads and returns bytes from
        a file. If 'end_idx' is bigger than file length, reads all 
        the way to the end (starting at 'start_idx').
        
            Its signature is:
        byte[] reader_func(location: Any, start_idx: int, end_idx: int)

        + Has 'size_getter' function that returns the number of bytes 
        the file has.
        
            Its signature is:
        non_negative_int size_getter(location: Any)
    
    + FileIndexer type:
        + Why: To easily handle different location types and
        reader functions. For example, a FilesInfo object might hold 
        local files and another one holds links to web documents.
        Core part of the program doesn't have to know about such 
        differences.
        
        + An object of this type (e.g FIDX) assigns every location
        an index (e.g lidx). Using this lidx, its related 'location',
        'reader_func', 'size_getter' can be retrieved in an uniform way
        via FIDX.
        
    + DuplicateFinder type:
        + Accepts a 'FileIndexer' object and a float value that denotes
        how similar can two files be if they are to be grouped as 
        duplicate. For example, 25% means that at least 25% of the files' 
        content starting from index 0 to 25% of the file must be the same.
        
        Concrete example: For 25% similarity constraint,
        file-1 = [0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1]
        file-2 = [1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1]
        these two files would NOT be grouped as duplicates. Because 
        their first element is different.
        
        + Has 'get_file_indexer' function. Returns the FileIndexer member.
        
        + Has 'group_files' function. Takes similarity percentage as float.
        A FileGroup is an iterable of file indices (from FileIndexer).
        'group_files' function returns an iterable of FileGroup elements. 
        
        + TODO(armagan): ???optional byte count constraint.
        + TODO(armagan): ???Make 'DuplicateFinder' just a function interface.
